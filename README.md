# Movie booking system.

This is a system which allows you to make a reservation for a movie or eventually buying it.
The functionality of the app is based on CRUD operations. It doesn't do anything fancy.
The principal requirement is: I want to see a movie, and when searching for the movie a list of all cinemas with that movie in different area zones (Locations) is displayed

The entities are:
  - Location
  - Cinema
  - Movie
  - Auditorium
  - Screening
  - Ticket
  - Client
